# Changelog

## [v0.0.2] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- Published under the [GWRG distribution
  spec](https://github.com/slash-proc/gwrg-dist-spec): a `manifest.json`
  describing this core and the system it provides, an offline bundle, and a
  GitHub Pages mirror of `dist/` that a web installer can read without a human
  in the loop.
- `symbols[]` publishes the linked ELF so a crash address from a device can be
  resolved back to a function. It is named by the manifest and mirrored, but is
  not part of the install set and never reaches the card.
- `gwrg.json`, the hand-written half of the manifest: the short console name
  and whether compressed ROMs work. Everything else -- the system, its folder,
  extensions and browse mode, the firmware ABI, sizes and hashes -- is derived
  from the packed binary at release time, so the manifest and the firmware
  cannot disagree about which folder the system reads.
- The Atari 7800 tab is keyed by the `a7800` folder the packed core names. The
  ProSystem BIOS is optional in the upstream emulator and this port never loads
  one -- `bios_enabled` is set false before every game -- so no `bios[]` is
  declared. Declaring a file the core will not read would send users hunting
  for it to no effect.

### Changed

- `scripts/make_manifest.py`, `build_dist.py`, `make_bundle.py` and
  `stage_release.py` are now the shared copies, byte-identical across every
  project. A script that has to be edited on the way in is a script that
  drifts.
- The Makefile answers `print-SIDECARS` and `print-RO_BIN`. This core installs
  neither, but the shared release script reads its variables positionally: a
  missing target shifts every later value onto the wrong name.


## [v0.0.1]

Initial public ProSystem (Atari 7800) core release.

### Added

- Nothing

### Changed

- Hot code in ITCM (Sally / Maria / Memory / ProSystem / Tia / Pokey / Riot).
- Hot WRAM (`memory_ram`) + POKEY mix buffer in DTCM; no ITCM data.

### Fixed

- Nothing

### Install

- Unzip the release archive onto the SD card root (`cores/prosystem.bin`).
- Place ROMs under `/roms/a7800/` (`.a78` / `.bin`).
- Requires firmware whose ABI matches `SDK_VERSION` in this repository.
